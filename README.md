Detect, recognize, and visualize with precision. Ideal for security, automation, research. Customizable, no false positives. GitHub for easy access and development.


The RCNN-SVM Fused Detection System is an advanced computer vision project that leverages the synergistic capabilities of two powerful machine learning techniques: Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). This project aims to provide robust and accurate object detection and recognition in images.

Key Features:

Object Detection with RCNN: The system employs RCNN to detect and locate objects of interest within input images. RCNN is a deep learning approach known for its exceptional object detection performance.

Feature Extraction: For each detected object, the system extracts relevant features, combining Convolutional Neural Network features and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features. This fusion of feature extraction methods contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the objects.

Support Vector Machine Classifier: These fused features are then classified using Support Vector Machines. SVM is a robust and versatile classification technique, particularly effective for complex decision boundaries.

Hybrid Approach: By merging the strengths of both RCNN and SVM, this system provides a hybrid approach to object detection, delivering high accuracy and minimizing false positives.

Training and Testing: The system allows training and fine-tuning of the classifier on custom datasets, making it adaptable to a wide range of object recognition tasks.

Visualization: It offers visualization capabilities to display detected objects and recognition results on input images.

Use Cases:

Security and Surveillance: The system can be utilized for surveillance systems, identifying and tracking objects of interest in security footage.

Image Tagging and Annotation: It is beneficial for automatically tagging and annotating images, facilitating content organization and retrieval.

Industrial Automation: In manufacturing and automation processes, this system can be used to detect and inspect products or components.
